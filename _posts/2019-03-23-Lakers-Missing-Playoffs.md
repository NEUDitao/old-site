A lot has happened since the Lakers have last made the playoffs. Gangnam Style
and Call Me Maybe just came out, shooting to the top of the summer 2012 charts.
The Mars Curiosity Rover just landed. The summer olympics were held in London.
The Avengers just came out. Obama was re-elected for his second term in office.
Windows 8 JUST came out! And we were still on the iPhone 5.

Even more has happened since Lebron James last missed the playoffs. 95.4% of
NBA players hadn't been drafted yet. Shrek 2 just released, with blink-182
and Green Day topping charts. Funnily enough, another Mars Rover also landed,
the Mars Spirit Rover. The olympics were held in Greece. And people were still
using Windows XP. 

Just goes to show the fan expectations coming into this season. The Lakers just
got, arguably, one of the best players of all time to join their team in LA. 
This *had* to be the first season since the fateful Steve Nash/Dwight Howard
experiment that the Lakers made the playoffs, right?

So what happened? Well, let's take a walk down 2018-2019 memory lane.


### July 9, 2018

Flip all tables, send out the horn calls, hallelujah the Lakers have just
signed **Lebron James**! The Lakers, with lots of cap room, and a promising
young core, are DESTINED to make the playoffs right? They just got the best
player in the NBA! Turn on the hype train.

### mere hours later...

And... the Lakers have let go of Julius Randle, their promising young power
forward. He went on to sign with the New Orleans Pelians.

Well, that's fine right? After all, he was at an over-crowded position. Ingram,
Kuzma, and James could all play that position. Plus, Randle wasn't a shooter,
which is the traditional type of player to play with Lebron. That's fine right?

### The following days..

After signing point guard Rajon Rando earlier in the offseason, the Lakers
then go on to sign... 0 shooters. A lot of washed up players who once had
promising futures, and... not much else. They also let go of one of their
shooters at the Center position, Brook Lopez. What are the Lakers doing?

To say at this time people had their reservations about the team was an
understatement. People could understand why these signings were made, all
players who were newly signed were offered only one year contracts, a clear
sign the Lakers were gearing up for a busy 2019 offseason. But people were
wary of the Lakers. They saw this team and said "Ok, Lebron wanted to add on
people who he's traditionally had trouble playing against before... let's see
how this season pans out.

### November 6, 2018

Sitting at 4-6, the Lakers weren't blowing people out of the water, but weren't 
disappointing either. Even though they were below .500, the team was showing
signs of promise, and then they signed Tyson Chandler. Chandler is a center
known for his solid defense, which was just what the lakers needed to plug up 
their weakness. And the Lakers popped off after that. They went 16-8 in the
next stretch, achieving the 4th seed and showing that the team was gelling 
until...


### December 25, 2018

Lebron James goes down in the third quarter with an injury to his groin. 
Even with that, the young Lakers core is able to pull together and defeat
the reigning champions, the Golden State Warriors. They'll be fine right?
Tha Lakers still would be able to come together with their young core,
especially with sophomore Kuzma showing promise.

### January 31, 2019

...26-25. Barely above .500, but still holding on to a playoff spot. Lebron
returns, the team is going again, the Lakers win against their hometown
rivals the Clippers... things are going to be alright, right? 

### February -- The Anthony Davis Saga

!["Season's over, isn't it?"](https://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/652*367/lebronsadus.jpg)

Do you know what's the best way to ensure your team no longer has any
chemistry? When it leaks that you're trying to trade basically your entire
team for one player. It came out that the Lakers were trying to trade 
Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram, Rajon Rando, Lance Stephenson,
Michael Beasley, and 2 first round picks for one player. Anthony Davis of
the New Orleans Pelicans. The thing was, the Pelicans were just trolling
the Lakers, dangling their star player Davis as a way to "get back" at Lebron
James' agent, Rich Paul. The Pelicans kept demanding more and more from the
trade, leaking every offer they received, until eventually rescinding the
offer altogether. This destroyed chemistry on the Lakers. Like, absolutely. 
The Lakers went 3-6 in february, after Lebron so boldly proclaimed he's
"activating playoffs mode early." And even though the Lakers traded their
promising young center Ivica Zubac for Mike "Stretch 5" Muscala... it wasn't
looking so hot in LA. 

### March. 1-10

The Phoenix Suns were the last place team in the NBA. 13-51. While they had
A lot of promising players, they were still raw and young, and needed time to
develop. Meanwhile, the Lakers had playoffs mode Lebron ready to make the
playoffs.

... Needless to say that was probably the final nail in the coffin for
the Lakers.

![Even Rondo doesn't want to sit with his team...](https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/styles/marquee_large_2x/public/2019/03/07/rajon-rondo-sits-away-teammates.jpg?itok=uQbWaJoz)

After the embarrassing loss to Phoenix, their hometown rivals, and an
Anothony Davis-less New Orleans Pelicans, the Lakers decided to call the
remainder of the season, and put Lebron James on a minutes restriction to 
give him some rest. The Lakers have since lost every game except one against
the low-seeded Chicago Bulls. 


### What's to be learned?

Reviosinist history is hard to look back on. this team went from rebuilding
middle year to championship contender back to tanker in the span of 8
quick months. Maybe they were unlucky, losing James, Rondo, B. Ingram, and
Ball for significant stretches of playing time. Maybe they have a bad coach
in the soon-to-be-fired Luke Walton. Maybe Magic Johnson, their GM, made
a few too many fumbles trading away promising young guys like Ivica Zubac
for people like Mike Muscala, who ended up with a bunch more DNPs added
under his belt. Either way, it shows a cautionary tale of too much hype,
and not having enough to support it.

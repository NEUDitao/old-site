Hello world! This is the first post on the refresh of my blog, so let's see
if it actually works well this time. Anyways, on to the main point of this post.


![Big bowl of ramen](https://www.kendallsq.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3d04970b-818e-4134-acd2-0ae2a1217410.jpg)

[Yume Wo Katare](https://www.yumewokatare.com/ "yume site"), is a place to go
when you want to chase your dreams. It also happens to be a ramen shop on the
side.

Wait what? Yeah that's right. Even though the fatty, rich garlic seems to
be the main draw for most patrons, the shop doesn't think so. "One bowl per
dreamer" is proudly displayed on its one-item menu, for the low-low price of
0 dollars. See, the bowl of ramen is supposed to be an analogy for your dreams,
where the ability to persevere through the heaping serving alludes to your
ability to perservere to achieve your dream. After your meal, you're given the
option to share your dream; the host will turn off the music and have you 
proclaim your dream to the world. 

Ok, but how's the food? Well, for a 13 dollar regular bowl, for a 15 dollar
"large" bowl (which comes with 3 more pieces of pork!), you get one over-sized
lump of noodles, fatty broth, bean sprouts, cabbage, and most importantly, the
*DELICIOUS GARLIC* (trust me, if you ever get the chance to go, you'll
understand). And oh boy, is it DELICIOUS. But it's a LOT of food, and it is
really **not** good for you. Some days there might even be too much oil, making
achieving a "perfect" nigh impossible. A perfect? Yeah, that's right, you're
graded on how much ramen you eat. If you finish the bowl, you get a 
**PERFECT**. Finish the solids? _Good Job_. Take a good dig at it? Almost.

Fail to make a dent? next time.

Trust me though, if you ever have the chance to go, you definitely should. The
small 18 seat shop usually has a line spilling out of it whenever it's open,
but that's just another testament to its popularity and timelessness. It also
happens to have a [sister Udon shop](https://www.facebook.com/yumegaarukara/)
next door, which is ALSO delicious. I take all my friends who visit Boston every
time... in fact, it's one of the dreams I shared! And so far, it's been a
**PERFECT**.
